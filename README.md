# Pham Hoang Anh (Pha)
I'm a Mechatronics major - AI researcher. I do:
- Reinforcement learning and Generative algorithms
- AI Agents (MCP)
- Digital twin

=> Didn't have any significantly projects yet, but I think NVIDIA should sponsor me

Anyway, check out the repos with descriptions (the ones without are mostly unstructured experiments)
